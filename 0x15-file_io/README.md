# 0x15-file_io README

This repository contains code for the 0x15-file_io project, which is part of the low-level programming curriculum at Holberton School. The purpose of this project is to introduce students to file input/output operations in the C programming language.

The main file for this project is `holberton.h`, which contains function prototypes for all the functions implemented in the project. The project includes the following C files:

-   `0-read_textfile.c`: A function that reads a text file and prints it to the POSIX standard output.
-   `1-create_file.c`: A function that creates a file and writes text to it.
-   `2-append_text_to_file.c`: A function that appends text to the end of a file.
-   `3-cp.c`: A program that copies the content of one file to another file.

All the C files in this repository have been compiled using `gcc 4.8.4` on Ubuntu 14.04. They should be compiled using the flags `-Wall`, `-Werror`, `-Wextra`, and `-pedantic`.

## Usage

To use any of the functions or programs in this repository, first clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/<username>/holbertonschool-low_level_programming.git
```

Navigate to the `0x15-file_io` directory and compile the desired C file using the following command:

```shell
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <outputfile>
```

Then run the compiled program using the following command:

```shell
$ ./<outputfile>
```
